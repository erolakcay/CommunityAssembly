Python code for simulations from "The balance of interaction types determines the assembly and stability of ecological communities" by Jimmy Qian and Erol Ak√ßay, 2019.

The code runs simulations of our model of community assembly. Data for communities are saved as Numpy .npz zipped archives of files named after the variables they contain.

"community-assembly-stability.py" simulates a single community whose parameters are defined within the script and by a command line argument. The script should be run with a command line argument, an integer between 0 to 593, that determines the parameter values that are used to simulate the community. As described in the Methods, there are a total of 66*3*3=594 parameter combinations we consider. There are 66 combinations of interaction types (proportions of mutualism, competition, and exploitation). There are 3 levels of connectivity and 3 values of the half-saturation constant. Data from these simulations were used to create all figures.
